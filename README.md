RULE: Use dummy content in prototype for proofing with client. Use fantasy to find some: for example Avita prints Textbooks. Add real content to real work after prototype version is signed by client. 

TODO frontend:
- Toggle button-text Lisa filter & rotate icon according to state
- Add content to filter (Erkki has ecxample), layout example under FAB-button
- Add content to login, layout example under FAB-button
- Actions logic for main toolbar: at the moment second click kills the bar
- Add functional part to language select
- Shall we rebuild bottomSheet as topSheet (notice animation direction) or can we separate an extra dialog for topSheet Dialog? The problem is that md-dialog-container is not accessible for extra classes.
